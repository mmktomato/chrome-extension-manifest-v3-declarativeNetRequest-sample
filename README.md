# Overview

Samples of Chrome Extension Manifest V3's `declarativeNetRequest`.

# Why

The way of modifying http requests and responses has changed in Manifest V3.

I tried the new `declarativeNetRequest` APIs and I felt they are a bit difficult. I wanted a simple usage example.
That's why I made these samples.
